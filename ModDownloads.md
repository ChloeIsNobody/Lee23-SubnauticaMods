This mod adds **two** new leviathans into the game.

A mysterious cargo ship crashed onto Planet 4546B five years ago. On board were various species of fauna, bioengineered by a shady company that is not formally recognized by Alterra. Most were destroyed in the explosion, but a few specimens managed to escape the wreckage. These terrors are only known under their codenames BLOOP and BLAZA.

The Bloop resides in shallow waters. Some places that you may have considered safe in the past are not so safe any more! Avoid this hungry beast at all costs.

The Blaza Leviathan inhabits various cave systems on the planet. This creature is over a hundred meters in length and has an incredibly powerful bite. It's swift and slender, so beware of ambush!

This mod adds several settings into the mod options tab related to changing the backgrounds of inventory icons.

It might seem like a small change, but it helps immensely with inventory management and organization. It looks great, too, and it's fully customizable.

If the built-in options are not enough, you have the choice to create your own custom icons by placing images into the Custom folder found within the mod.
