Adds a new vehicle in the form of a boat. Being slightly larger than the cyclops, it allows you to quickly travel across planet 4546B and gives you plenty of space for building.

The Sea Voyager acts as a great alternative to a starting base. It has the same functionalities as a base would but it can move freely throughout the surface of 4546B. With the [BuildingTweaks](https://github.com/MrPurple6411/MrPurple6411-Subnautica-Mods/releases) mod by MrPurple you can even build on the deck!

Requirements:
- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

### [CustomInventoryColors](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/CustomInventoryColors.zip) - Added Oct 15 2022, last updated Oct 15 2022
[Download page with more information](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/blob/main/Downloads/DownloadPages/CustomInventoryColors.md) - [Source Code](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/tree/main/InventoryColorCustomization)

</div>

This mod adds several settings into the mod options tab related to changing the backgrounds of inventory icons.

It might seem like a small change, but I can assure it helps immensely with inventory management and organization. It looks great, too, and it's fully customizable.

If the built-in options are not enough, you have the choice to create your own custom icons by placing images into the Custom folder found within the mod.

This wonderful mod was designed by Dinofuzz, and I took the responsiblity to bring these amazing creature models to life. De-Extinction adds 15 concept art creatures into the world alongside some miscellaneous content. Among these features includes several edible fish, massive herbivores, collectible eggs, plankton, and even the Gulper Leviathan!

A necessity for all creature mods.

This is a modding library that helps modders create their own creatures with a flexible system and minimal redundant code. This mod must be installed like any other QMod for creature mods to function properly.

## Commissioned mods

### [RandomEvents](https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/RandomEvents.zip) - Added Oct 16 2022, last updated Nov 5 2021
<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/LeeTwentyThree/Lee23-SubnauticaMods/raw/main/Downloads/Thumbnails/RandomEvents.png" width=200px>
</div>

A random event happens every 30 seconds. Maybe a Ghost Leviathan will spawn outside your base. Maybe water (bottles) will rain from the sky. Or Shrek will look down upon you from space. This mod is very dangerous, so install at your own risk.

Requirements:
- [SMLHelper](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)

These mods were not designed for regular playthroughs, but I am uploading them here for people who are curious to try them.
